{{#if product.brand.name "==" "Wood craft from Spain"}}
<p><strong>{{product.brand.name}}</strong> - Our wooden range has a strong European design heritage. The patterns are sourced from designers in Spain, Italy and France, and the workshop that produces our wooden pieces is in Madrid, Spain.</p>
<p>The workshop has a long-standing partnership with a charity that helps young people and adults with learning disabilities spend time learning traditional skills and independent living. They use techniques including decoupage (the layering of fine quality paper onto wood and sealing with layers of lacquer), gold and silver leaf painting and hand painting effects. All the wood used is sustainably sourced.</p>

{{else if product.brand.name "==" "Secrets of Florentine gilding"}}
<p><strong>{{product.brand.name}}</strong> - Our Florentine range of bins are made in Florence, Italy, and their style is inspired by this great city. We source them from a tiny fourth-generation family business. They use the same traditional technique of gold-leaf gilding that decorated the opulent palaces of Renaissance Florence.</p>
<p>Applying gold leaf requires incredible skill. The leaf itself is so fragile that it cannot be handled with bare hands. Learning to apply it can take many years, but the results are beautiful, transforming objects into glowing works of art. All wood used is sustainably sourced.</p>

{{else if product.brand.name "==" "Master painters in Rajasthan"}}
<p><strong>{{product.brand.name}}</strong> - Our toleware and chinoiserie bins and tissue boxes are delicately hand-painted by a small family business in Rajasthan, the heart of craft in India. These craftspeople use fine painting skills passed down through generations of master painters who decorated the opulent palaces of this royal State.</p>
<p>These traditional techniques use vibrant colours and wonderful detail, influences which are visible in our range. Our Rajasthani workshop produces toleware (delicately painted metal) and chinoiserie (Chinese and East Asian inspired design) along with timeless contemporary and classic designs.</p>

{{else if product.brand.name "==" "Beautiful baskets from Vietnam"}}
<p><strong>{{product.brand.name}}</strong> - Our classic rattan waste paper baskets are designed in France and made in rural Vietnam using local natural materials. The French design adds a touch of style to the durability and practicality of this ancient rural eco craft. Our family-run Vietnamese workshop provides employment for families in the local rural area.</p>
<p>Rattan is harvested from a climbing vine that grows in jungle habitats across Asia. It produces a springy, flexible wood that is extremely strong, one of the strongest natural materials in the world. Basket weaving is a traditional skill in all cultures, but the use of rattan originated in Asia where rattan has been harvested and woven into wickerwork for thousands of years. Originally rattan baskets were produced as an everyday tool of rural life, until in the 15th Century when ratan products and the skills required to make them were exported to Europe where they became fashionable.</p>

{{else if product.brand.name "==" "Basket craft from the Philippines"}}
<p><strong>{{product.brand.name}}</strong> - Our Watervine range is made from the Nito vine, a slender fern plant native to the Philippines. The Nito stem darkens as It grows, turning from green to brown and eventually black. This mix of lighter and darker colours gives watervine products a distinctive appearance, different to standard rattan. The plant grows high up and is more challenging to harvest than rattan. In fact, it takes longer to gather the vine than it does for the native Filipino weavers to make the basket!</p>
<p>There is a long basket-making tradition in the Philippines, now a major centre of basket-weaving craft. The process is still done entirely by hand, producing extremely high-quality products.</p>

{{else if product.brand.name "==" "Passionate craftsmanship from India"}}
<p><strong>{{product.brand.name}}</strong> - Our makers in North India produce beautiful pieces in leather, stainless steel, wood and mother- of-pearl inlay. Their work is eye-catching and tactile.</p>
<p>They source the finest possible materials from India itself, including sustainable wood, horn, bone, stainless steel and brass. When top quality materials are not available locally, they source from specialist centres across the world, such as leather from Italy and South America and black lip pearls from Asia-Pacific. Fine craftsmanship, passion and years of training and experience go into making these designs.</p>

{{else if product.brand.name "==" "Eco craft and empowerment in Burkina Faso"}}
<p><strong>{{product.brand.name}}</strong> - Our range of eco bins are designed in France and woven from recycled plastic in Burkina Faso, Africa.</p>
<p>Waste from plastic bags and bottles is collected and cleaned, then local women in rural communities crochet the recycled material into strong and durable baskets. Because no dye is used, the baskets are in eye-catching monochrome, the original colours of carrier bags in Burkina Faso. It takes up to seven days to create a finished basket, using approximately 100 carrier bags.</p>
