<p>We want to ensure your printed product is as captivating as it can be. This starts with a good quality, high resolution design file from you. There are product templates available for download on each product page which can be used to help set up your design file.</p>
<p><span>The best format to send your design to us is a PDF. However, you can also supply in the following formats:</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #ee8600;"><strong>FILE FORMATS</strong></span></h4>
<p><strong>PDF</strong></p>
<p><span>PDFs are the best way to provide your artwork to us. You can export PDFs from all design software (try File&gt;Save or File&gt;Export) or you can use software called a PDF Printer (File&gt;print&gt;select-PDF Printer), or there are various online PDF converters.</span></p>
<p><span>When creating the PDF, there will be a PDF options box. In this window you may have to specify the CMYK colour and image resolution of High or 300dpi. </span></p>
<p><strong>EPS</strong></p>
<p><span>When supplying as EPS make sure that all fonts are embedded, and that you include document thumbnails. Transparency resolution should be set to High. All files should also be in CMYK colour mode and have all relevant bleeds included.</span></p>
<p><strong>JPEG / TIFF</strong></p>
<p><span>If you are sending us a JPEG or TIFF, it is vital that each time you save the image, you select MAXIMUM quality. </span></p>
<p><span>Please ensure that these file types are created at high resolution (300 dpi) and are in CMYK colour mode and have all relevant bleeds included.</span></p>
<p><strong>ILLUSTRATOR FILES (.AI)</strong></p>
<p><span>If supplying as Ai files, please ensure that all images are embedded (you will be prompted when importing images) and all text is converted to outlines. Please bear in mind though that there is no advantage to supplying in this format and PDF is always preferable.</span></p>
<p><span>Please ensure that all images you use are at high resolution (300 dpi) and that the document is in CMYK colour mode and has all relevant bleeds included.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">MICROSOFT OFFICE or APPLE PAGES</span></strong></p>
<p><span>We <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">do not accept</span></strong> artwork in any Microsoft format or Apple Pages, this includes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Word</span></li>
<li><span>Excel</span></li>
<li><span>Powerpoint</span></li>
<li><span>Publisher</span></li>
<li><span>Works</span></li>
<li><span>Pages</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>If you are using one of these software’s, you can can convert these files into a PDF, by using the FREE conversion tool at: <a href="https://www.zamzar.com/">https://www.zamzar.com/</a></span></p>
<p><span>It is important when supplying a PDF from a Microsoft or Apple documents, that care is taken to ensure the size of your document is as per the specific product size including bleeds.</span></p>
<p><span>** Please note – When using any Microsoft or Apple softwares, we highly recommend you select the proof upgrade option on the product page when ordering. We will check your file over and email you a proof to check all is as you thought, prior to going into production.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #ee8600;"><strong style="font-size: 1em;">ARTWORK BLEED</strong></span></h4>
<p><span>It is essential that there is a minimum of 3mm bleed on all sides around your artwork. When you have background images or colour in your design, bleed is to ensure that no white appears around your product when cut to size. We print on larger sheets then cut down to the finish size of the product, so the ‘bleed’ is a must. For example: A6 size is 148mm x 105mm, with bleed the file size would be 154mm x 111mm. Please note that there is a 1-2mm tolerance of movement for cutting on all jobs.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #ee8600;"><strong>IMPOSITION</strong></span></h4>
<p><span>Please ensure that you sent all artworks as single pages and not as page spreads.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #ee8600;"><strong>PROOFING</strong></span></h4>
<p>If you are unsure if your artwork is suitable, we offer a low cost proofing upgrade option on the product page. We will check over your file, convert any RGB Colours to CMYK if required, and send back a proof via email for you to double check everything, prior to going into production. If preferred, you can choose to continue your purchase without the proofing option, where your file will go straight to print.</p>
<p>Remember a proof is submitted to you to ensure the accuracy of your printed products. You, the customer, are responsible for ensuring the complete accuracy of your proof. After agreeing to the Proof Approval document sent via email, you are responsible for any errors or omissions not indicated at this time. In addition, if you decide to proceed without our proof and check service, you are confirming that any errors in the artwork are your own repsonibility and you are agreeing to ours terms &amp; conditions.</p>
