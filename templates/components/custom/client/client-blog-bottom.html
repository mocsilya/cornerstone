				<p>Handle-iT SL, Further to five years of huge expansion within Handle-iT Ltd, including a further 15 countries added to our export clientele, coupled with the continuous unsettled environment of exporting between the UK and EU. It became apparent that growth and deliveries into the European Union would become more and more difficult. So the move to find a base in Europe where Handle-iT could continue to expand without boundaries became the natural next step. At the back end of 2022 we signed and agreement with our facilities provider for a 5 years term in our premises in Tarragona with Spainâ€™s vibrant economy coupled with great access from the UK, and furthermore great access to the rest of the EU, along with well educated technically astute work force, the match was made for us.</p>
